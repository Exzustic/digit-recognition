# Digit Recognition
A simple Python project for handwritten digit recognition using a deep learning model.

## Introdution
This project demonstrates handwritten digit recognition (for example, digits 0–9) using CNN. The repository includes the trained model (`digit_recognition_model.keras`), a Jupyter notebook for experiments (`experiment.ipynb`), and a simple streamlit application (`app.py`).
## Features
* Pre‑trained deep learning model for digit classification.
* Experimentation notebook to explore model architecture and training process.
* Simple Python script (app.py) to load the model and perform inference.
* Dependencies captured in requirements.txt.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* Recommended virtual environment (venv, conda, etc)
* The required Python packages listed in requirements.txt
* Install dataset from `https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data` to folder `dataset`
## Running Application
```
streamlit run app.py
```
